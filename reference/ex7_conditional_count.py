Now that we know how to loop through files, let's start pulling out some insights about the LLC workshops in 2014

We want to know how many people attended 'National Learn to Code Day' in 2014.
Fortunately, each of those events those *exact* words in the title, so we can look for them (remember, computers are
painfully literal, so your search terms have to match exactly)

Once we know how many people attended last year, we can aim to increase that number in 2015!
